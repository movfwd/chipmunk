	  If your system has a block of fast (comparable in access speed to
	  system memory) and non-volatile byte-addressable memory and you wish
	  to mount a light-weight filesystem with strong consistency support
	  over it, say Y here.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called nova.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NOVA_BUG1
	bool "NOVA bug 1"
	help
	  Inject NOVA bug \#1 into the system. This bug causes NOVA to use perform an 
	  out-of-bounds array access on a system with 1 CPU, which results in a null 
	  pointer dereference. This bug causes a kernel panic, so it should be turned off
	  if you are looking to reproduce any other bugs.

config NOVA_BUG2
	bool "NOVA bug 2"
	help 
	  Inject NOVA bug \#2 into the system. This bug occurs due to a missing cache line 
	  flush and results in an inaccessible file. 

config NOVA_BUG3
	bool "NOVA bug 3"
	help
	  Inject NOVA bug \#3 into the system. This bug occurs due to incorrect assumptions 
	  in recovery code about inode log pointer management and causes a null pointer 
	  dereference. This bug causes a kernel panic, so it should be turned off if you
	  are looking to reproduce any other bugs.

config NOVA_BUG4
	bool "NOVA bug 4"
	help
	  Inject NOVA bug \#4 into the system. This bug occurs because the removal of the 
	  old dentry is not properly journaled during rename(). It results in file loss
	  if the system crashes while renaming a file.

config NOVA_BUG5
	bool "NOVA bug 5"
	help
	  Inject NOVA bug \#5 into the system. This bug occurs because certain values 
	  associated with dentries are not included in journal entries. It leaves a file 
	  inaccessible and corrupted if the system crashes while renaming a file.

config NOVA_BUG6
	bool "NOVA bug 6"
	help 
		Inject NOVA bug \#6 into the system. This bug occurs because link count may be updated
		in place if there is already a link count change entry in the journal, which is not 
		crash-safe. It causes link to be non-atomic in this case, leaving a file with an 
		incorrect link count after a crash.

config NOVA_BUG7
	bool "NOVA bug 7"
	help
		Inject NOVA bug \#7 into the system. This bug occurs because log entries may be read 
		in an incorrect order after modifying and truncating a file using multiple file 
		descriptors. It causes incorrect file size and potential data loss after a crash.

config NOVA_BUG8
	bool "NOVA bug 8"
	help
		Inject NOVA bug \#8 into the system. This bug occurs due to incorrect blocknr calculation
		after using truncate and fallocate on a file with multiple file descriptors. It causes data loss. 

config NOVA_FORTIS_BUG1
	bool "NOVA-Fortis bug 1"
	help 
		Inject NOVA-Fortis bug \#1 into the system. Caused by a missing fence that allows updates to primary and backup logs to be reordered incorrectly. 

config NOVA_FORTIS_BUG2
	bool "NOVA-Fortis bug 2"
	help
		Inject NOVA-Fortis bug \#2 into the system. Caused by incorrect handling of primary and backup 
		inode logs. Only one log may be initialized after a crash, but both are required to be properly
		initialized to perform many operations.

config PMFS_BUG1
	bool "PMFS bug 1"
	help 
		Inject PMFS bug \#1 into the system. Occurs because of a logic error where files that were being
		truncated during a crash are resolved before scanning FS metadata during recovery. This results in
		an access to lost volatile data, causing a null pointer dereference during recovery. Causes a 
		kernel panic.

config PMFS_BUG2
	bool "PMFS bug 2"
	help
		Inject PMFS bug \#2 into the system. Causes data write to be non-synchronous due to a missing fence.

config PMFS_BUG4
	bool "PMFS bug 4"
	help
		Inject PMFS bug \#4 into the system. Causes lost data when performing non-8-byte-aligned writes due to a bug in the function that flushes edge cache lines.

config WINEFS_BUG1
	bool "WineFS bug 1"
	help 
	  Inject WineFS bug \#1 into the system. Caused by an error when accessing per-CPU journals during recovery. Prevents new files from being created or deleted.

config WINEFS_BUG2
	bool "WineFS bug 2"
	help 
		Inject WineFS bug \#3 into the system. Causes data write to be non-synchronous due to a missing fence.

config WINEFS_BUG3
	bool "WineFS bug 3"
	help
		Inject WineFS bug \#3 into the system. Causes lost data when performing non-8-byte-aligned writes due to a bug in the function that flushes edge cache lines.

config WINEFS_BUG4
	bool "WineFS bug 4"
	help
	  Inject WineFS bug \#4 into the system. Causes data writes to be not atomic even in strict mode.
